        "This website was made by me. I used React to create it. To create the website I needed to do research on what other software engineer’s have used for their portfolios. After I gained an understanding on typical site structure of the site being one page with an about section, skills, projects, and a contact form. I then used Canva’s website builder as a starting point to map out how I wanted the website to look like. Then I started building this site. Overall it was a great experience to work on. There were challenges while building, but with help of the internet and peers I was able to overcome them to create the site you see now.        ",

      description:
        "PASS is a part of Academic support at UON. It stands for peer assisted study sessions. To obtain this role I needed to perform well in a specific course. Pass roles include: COMP1140 (Database and Information Management) and ENGG1500 (Introduction to Professional Engineering). In this role, I organise sessions for students to attend and assist them in their studies for the course. Each week I would work independently to prepare worksheets that assist students in their revision. As a student that has taken the course, I am able to provide advice on how to best revise for the course, and I am able to help students improve their analytical skills, motivation, and study habits. I also get to have close contact with the professor of the course to provide feedback to the professor on students' views of the course. This assists in bettering the course in real time for students as they undertake it. Students have given me feedback that this has helped them achieve high marks.",
